# About this Specialization
This specialization is intended for people with some programming experience who seek an approachable introduction to how operating systems work on a fundamental level. This course will equip learners with foundational knowledge of operating systems suitable for any developer roles. In these four courses, you will cover everything from the basics of a C program to distributed systems. These topics will help prepare you to optimize the performance of the programs you write.

# Applied Learning Project
This specialization covers introductory level operating system ideas, techniques, and implementations. The specialization is divided into four parts: 
1. [Virtualization; and](./Virtualization/README.md) `to be continued`
2. [Memory Management.](./Memory_Management/README.md) 
3. [Concurrency,](./Concurrency/README.md) `to be continued`
4. [Persistence.](./Persistence/README.md) 

Examples of practical applications include implementing a command line interpreter, and multi-threaded operating system tools.
