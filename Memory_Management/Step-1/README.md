# Segmentation

## Learning Objectives
- How can we support a large address space that could possibly have a lot of free space between the stack and the heap?
- How should variable-size requests be managed?
- How can we reduce fragmentation?
- What are the time and space overheads of different approaches?
- Implement malloc() and free() functions for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
