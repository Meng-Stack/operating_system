# Paging

## Learning Objectives
- How can we virtualize memory with pages without segmentation issues?
- What are the basic concepts?
- How can we make those strategies work well while saving space and time?
- How can we reduce the time it takes to translate addresses and prevent the extra memory reference that paging appears to necessitate?
- What kind of hardware is required?
- What level of OS engagement is required?
- Would it be possible to make page tables smaller?
- What are the main ideas?
- Are there any inefficiencies associated with these new data structures?
