# Exercise 3

## Question 1
**Solid-state storage devices** have **transistors** instead of moving parts. They can retain information in the event of a power outage. **Flash chips** can store bits in a transistor. These are grouped into **banks** or **planes** composed of several cells.

## Question 2
**Read**, **Erase**, and **Program** are the low-level operations that are supported by flash operations.
