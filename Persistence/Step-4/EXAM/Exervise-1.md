# Exercise 1
Create a UDP server and client.  

The server should:  

- receive messages from the client
- respond back to the client as confirmation

The client should:
- Send a hello message to the server
- Receive the confirmation message from the client

Running the server and client in separate terminals, your output should look like the following:

## Terminal 1

```bash
./server
Client Says: Hello, how are you?
Response sent.
```

## Terminal 2

```bash
./client
Hello message sent.
Server Says: Hello, I am fine. thank you.
```
